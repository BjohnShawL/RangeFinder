# RangeFinder
RangeFinder source code
The basic premise is to take a number range, and a list of active users, and find the spare (unassigned) numbers within the ranges that a person owns. Eventually this will allow for instant number checking (type a number into a field, have it tell you who that number is assigned to, or if it's free)
